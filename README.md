# Popular Movies

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

# Features

With the app, you can:

Discover the most popular, highest rated movies
Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
Watch trailers
Read reviews

# How to Work with the Source

This app uses The [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:  `res/strings.xml
